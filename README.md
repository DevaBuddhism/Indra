# Indra
Indra is a Quantum Computing Environment for the future.  

## Quantum Computing Environment

Indra is a Quantum Computing Environment formulated from natural elements residing on the planetary surface of instillation.  These natural elements form a bonded energy network with the nearest Solar Object as a natural energy source.

The base method of interaction is a naturally enhanced semi-telepathic holographic user interface that is emitted from a removable device that is linked to biometrics of the corresponding user.  

## Logic Center
  - Logic processor contains equations that are the first step to apply before neural decisions are made.

## Neural Center
  - Builds decision models based on returned logic set.

## Learning Center
  - Devise recipes based on logic equations and neural decisions
  
## Creative Center
  - Take resultset returned from Logic, Neural, and Learning Centers to form the creative idea

## User Interaction

## Protocols

## System Architecture
