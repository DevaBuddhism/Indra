## Quantum Computing Environment

Indra is a Quantum Computing Environment formulated from natural elements residing on the planetary surface of instillation.  These natural elements form a bonded energy network with the nearest Solar Object as a natural energy source.

The base method of interaction is a naturally enhanced semi-telepathic holographic user interface that is emitted from a removable device that is linked to biometrics of the corresponding user.
